Easy real-time polling

## Getting Started

Clone the code, enable web support for flutter, and run!

Only for desktop web at the moment.

## Todo
This is in a "good enough" state, where it will probably remain for quite some time (or forever).

1 and 2 I would consider "must haves" to be "production-ready" but it's being used by real users right now so what do I know.
1. This code is very much not DRY. 
2. Scaling is hacky and doesn't look that good. It would be great if it looked better (should be easy after DRYing out, just move the top bar to an app bar or FittedBox a new nested column)
3. Security rules perhaps
4. Delete old data from the db
